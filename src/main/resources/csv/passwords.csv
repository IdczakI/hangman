courtesy costs nothing
a penny saved is a penny gained
doing is better than saying
knowledge is power
the early bird catches the worm
love is blind
east or west home is best
practise make perfect
a friend in need is a friend indeed
easy come easy go
better late than never
easier said than done
all is well than ends well
speech is silver silence is golden
a friend to all is a friend to none
beware of silent dog and still water
every man has his faults
the grass is always greener
a man is as old as he feels
never judge a book by its cover
all roads lead to rome
experience is the mother of wisdom
actions speak louder than words
